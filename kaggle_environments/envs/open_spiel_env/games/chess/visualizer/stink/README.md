# Chess Visualizer (React + Zustand)

This is a test version of a visualizer that is built with `react` as the frontend framework, and `zustand` for state management. It also uses `react-chessboard`.

Install requirements.

`pnpm install`

Run for dev using a local data file for the chess match.

`pnpm dev-with-replay`

You can also build a deployable version that uses the data file for sharing and
internal review.

`pnpm build-with-replay`
